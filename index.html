I learned the basics of python in an introductory course in college and now use the language in order to analyze large sets of data in my other programming courses. </p>

                <p> The summer of 2021 I worked on creating a personal wesbite where I could showcase my creativity using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. I wanted this wesbite to be used by others to learn more about my technical skills as well as the projects that I have worked on.

                <p>In the Spring of 2022, I took a class called Fundamentals of Software Engineering. In this class for my final project I created a movie finder app and I launched it using Heruko. This app allows users to search up American movies made between the years of 1980-2010; using the year, title, and keywords specific to that movie. I created a json file with movie data, then used this file to create a MongoDB cloud database with this information. Lastly, I used javascript to get information from the database based on the users request, HTML5, and CSS in order to format my page, and lastly launched it on Heruko. </p>

                <img class = "geo" src = "images/Appyters.png"/>
                <p> The GEOscRNAseq2Appyter Chrome Extension is a Google Chrome extension that creates Jupyter Notebooks that contain scRNA-seq data analysis. The Jupyter Notebooks contain interactive data visualizations and other standard methods of analysis. The purpose of the Google Chrome extension is to enable researchers to analyze the raw sequencing data provided on GEO and draw valuable conclusions from reanalysis of these datasets for their own research. I worked on the GEOscRNAseqAppyter during my internship with the Ma'ayan lab in the summer of 2021. I helped to create a feature where the google chrome extension would only pop up on the screen of GEO pages with single cell RNA sequencing data that the Appyter could analyze. I also worked on sending the information from the GEO page to the jupyter notebook.
